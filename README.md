# 🏎️ XOva-Tweak

**Testing for XOS Framework**

Yo! Welcome to **XOva-Tweak**, a lightweight but powerful performance engine designed for Infinix & Xiaomi devices. This module is built to be simple (Plug n Play) but still gives you that expert-level optimization for your favorite apps.

## 🚀 What's inside?

- **Hybrid Core Logic**: Dynamic detection of background services.
- **App Manager (Targeted Optimization)**:
  - **DexOpt Speed**: Re-compile apps on the fly for faster loading.
  - **Performance Mode**: Unlocks CPU/GPU potential and restricts background chaos to just 3 processes.
  - **Extreme Restrict**: Put those power-hungry apps to deep sleep when you don't need them.
- **Global System Boost**: One-tap cleanup of cache, RAM, and XOS bloatware.
- **XOS Safe Debloater**: Smashes over 30+ non-essential Transsion bloatware without breaking your launcher.

## 🛠️ How to use?

1. Install this module via **AxManager** or **KernelSU**.
2. Open the WebUI.
3. Hit **Boost Now** on the Home tab for a fresh start.
4. Go to **Apps** tab, enter your game's package name (like `com.mobile.legends`), and hit **Performance Mode**.
5. Enjoy the smoothness!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Do With Your Own Risk (DWYOR).** This module tweaks system settings. While it's designed to be safe, I'm not responsible for any bricked bricks or exploded batteries. Use it wisely!
